This notebook is part of a thesis research project by a Bachelor UNIBZ student graduating in the academic year of 2024.

It aims to use a publicly-available dataset to compare, train and build regression models for predicting the surge multiplier and the final comprehensive price of a ride for shared-mobility software platforms operating within the context of a dynamic and evolving market.

Information about the models and the theory was taken from the following source(s):
